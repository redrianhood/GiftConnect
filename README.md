### A place to make gift lists and store all the info you could want

Have you ever wanted to go gift shopping for the holidays or someone's birthday, but perhaps you just wanted to make a list you could refer back to later?

GiftConnect is designed as a place to store the data you want for a gift list (and share it with family or friends [in-development])
